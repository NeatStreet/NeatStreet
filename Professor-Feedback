This seems appropriate in scope.
I like that you're tackling a scoped problem.
It would be great if the scope included some ideas of how to really make the site usable and useful beyond standard practice.
(In other words, one danger I see with projects like this is a resulting site that isn't much better than existing library sites, or picks on really bad ones-- I hope you'll be ambitious and next-level with this.)
